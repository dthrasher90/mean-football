                Welcome to Head Coach.  The only football head coach RPG on
                the internet.  In this game, you will assume the role of a
                head coach.  Your first task is to pick four players which
                will be the corner stone of your team.  These players include
                a quarterback, wide reciever, halfback and a middle linebacker.
                 Through out the course of the game, you can use coaching points for a
                 chance to gain bonuses to boost abilities.
